This Shiny App is for searching and visulizating the Daily air quality measurements in New York, May to September 1973.  
It allows the user to plot a histogram of different air quality measurements (Ozone, Solar Radiation, Wind and Temperature) during this timeframe.
  
  
**The project is on Shiny User Showcase page (Shiny Apps with popular appeal): https://jorgeh08.shinyapps.io/shinyapp/.**
